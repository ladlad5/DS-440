      "First, the patient's presentation: she was 17 years old, nonparous (non-pregnant), with a one-month history of a pelvic mass. That’s pretty significant because non-paranoids usually don’t have such a high risk of parity. They might have more concerning signs like nausea or vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor in 2007. The CA-125 test showed a raised serum level, which is concerning. The patient wasn’t able to do the financial checkup, so she probably can't discuss other aspects of her medical history beyond what’s given here.\n",
      "\n",
      "An intraoperative frozen section showed an immature teratoma, and she had fertility sparing surgery. I should include that. Fertility sparing is a standard surgical procedure for ovarian tumors in cases where there's some concern about whether the tumor might return or spread laterally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment involved several procedures: staging laparotomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy (which looks at the abdomen and pelvis), peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and an infracolic omentectomy. Each of these is a standard procedure for managing ovarian tumors, especially when they are localized.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the surgery, the postoperative histology report found a mature teratoma with focal areas of immature teratomas in the left ovary. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes, which is important for determining whether the tumor has spread beyond those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wasn’t supposed to be closely surveillance until six months after the first operation. She defaulted and went ahead, but her follow-up after that didn’t show any recurrence yet. The CT scan showed no residual disease, and the histology confirmed a mature teratoma with no immature cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the next year: she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and decided for medical advice again. She developed CA-125 raised levels post-chemotherapy, which was concerning because her tumor marker levels normalized. The pelvic masses showed some recurrence with larger size. CT scan revealed bilateral large adnexal masses involving the uterus and possibly the sigmoid colon.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was suspicion of growing teratoma syndrome, which sounds like the tumors are interfering with each other, maybe causing a new growth. She had staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumor. Full pelvic lymphadenectomy was done as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Postoperative CT scan showed no residual disease, histology confirmed a matureterima, but without any signs of further infiltration. So she was safe from recurrence at this time.\n",

      "The patient is a 17-year-old nonparous girl who presented with a one-month history of a noticeable pelvic mass. She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor on January 15, 2007. Despite having the ability to discuss her medical history due to the lack of other concerns, she chose to proceed unopposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Plan**\n",
      "The patient underwent several surgical procedures:\n",
      "- **Staging Laparotomy**: To localize the tumor and remove it.\n",
      "- **Left Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: To visualize the abdomen and pelvis.\n",
      "- **Peritoneal Cytology**: To examine the peritoneal cavity.\n",
      "- **Pelvic Lymph Node Sampling**: To assess the extent of lymphoid involvement.\n",
      "- **Infracolic Omentectomy**: To remove any small masses present in the pelvic bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Outcome**\n",
      "After the surgery, the postoperative histology report revealed a mature left ovary tumor with focal areas of immature teratomas. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. The tumor cells were FIGO stage 1a and grade I according to FIGO staging.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Follow-Up**\n",
      "One year later, she presented again following radiological recurrence in pelvic mass and her CA-125 levels increased to 180 IU/L due to chemotherapy. She underwent complete excision of the tumor and full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The postoperative CT scan revealed no residual disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "At this time, there was no recurrence at the report date, which is eight months after the second surgery for GTS (Growing Teratomics and Solid tumors). All findings were consistent with a localized, FIGO stage 1a, grade I tumor.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this task. The user provided a lot of medical information about a patient who went from presenting with abdominal pain for two weeks to being discharged with a diagnosis of parasitic infections like Cryptosporidium. Then it became worse again after two days, and they needed more treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the main steps here are to create a medical report based on this information. The user wants me to translate that into a proper medical format consistently. So I need to structure it with clear sections like history, physical exam, findings, differential diagnoses, treatment plan, and conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by collecting all the patient's details—age, demographics, past history, presentation. Then move on to physical exam findings: abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss. Next, the differential diagnoses—I need to list possible causes like parasitic infections, gastrointestinal issues from other causes (like C. fumigansqueas), and things like C. elegans or Leptospirosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I'll outline the treatment plan based on each differential. The initial treatment is prednisone, which seems appropriate for pain management. Then steroids are given to reduce inflammation. Praziquantel (albendazole) should be used to treat parasitic infections if any are present. Lastly, they consider a bariatric surgery for more significant issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the conclusion, I'll summarize how the treatment plan addressed the patient's condition effectively. Maybe include reassurance that the patient is doing well and offer further support options like follow-up or rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure each section flows into the next, using consistent terminology and structure. Also, I have to avoid any personal pronouns or names, just stick to the facts provided. The user also emphasized consistency in responses, so each part of the report should align without exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should watch out for specific terms like \"bowel sounds\" vs. \"bailey's test,\" but I can keep it simple as long as it's clear from context. Also, note that after discharge, there was a trial of albendazole, which is important to mention since they used that treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the goal is to present all this information in an organized, clear manner that other healthcare professionals could use directly. It's crucial to be precise with medical terminology and ensure each part builds upon the previous one logically.\n",

      "A 55-year-old Vietnamese male presents to a local emergency room after experiencing generalized abdominal pain for two weeks. The patient described cramping, generalized onset, and progressive worsening with no connection to meals. Pain persisted throughout the day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting ( Clear material). No significant recent symptoms or associations were noted, including fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bowel habits, sick contacts, raw food consumption, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash.\n",

      "**Introduction**\n",
      "A 43-year-old man presented with chest pain described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, 8/10 in severity, radiating down his left arm. Vital signs were stable, cardiac biomarkers within normal limits, and the EKG showed no ST/T-waves changes. The echocardiogram revealed normal ventricular function and no wall motion abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Present Examination Findings**\n",
      "Upon presentation, chest pain was characterized as moderate in severity (8/10). Detailed examination revealed normal vital signs. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed normal left ventricle function and no evidence of wall motion abnormalities or coronary vasospasm. Two weeks prior, similar chest pain and ER course were reported.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Detailed Findings from Tests**\n",
      "Chronic cardiokymography further identified normal coronary arteries without evidence of coronary vasospasm or myocardial bridge. Slow flow was noted in the LAD, and an intracoronary adenosine challenge revealed normalization of TIMI frame counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Diagnosis**\n",
      "The patient's presentation led to a diagnosis of coronary slow flow phenomenon. Treatment included dipyridamole 50 mg three times daily, with discharge home.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Followup Results**\n",
      "Six months later, the patient reported chest-pain-free following treatment. Subsequently, the patient experienced chest pain, which was resolved after placement of dipyridamole. Detailed followup confirmed full resolution of chest pain and no recurrence over six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",

      "Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided some medical notes from a second case involving a 70-year-old gentleman with history of squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue base six years prior. He had chest pain at rest, which was described as pressure-like, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Admission EKG showed T-wave inversion in anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with CKMB 8.3 IU/l and troponin I 1.14 ng/mL.\n",

      "Admission echocardiogram was normal, no wall motion issues or left ventricular hypertrophy. Diagnosis of NSTEMI made, medications taken as acute coronary syndrome.

      "A 70-year-old gentleman with a prior medical history of squamous cell carcinoma on the base of his tongue was admitted to the hospital for evaluation due to chest pain at rest. The patient presented as \"pressure-like\" and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, which may be related to underlying conditions or stressors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "** presentation:**  \n",
      "The admission was confirmed by an EKG, which revealed a T-wave inversion in the anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval (0.72 s, 599 ms). Cardiac enzymes were elevated, with CKMB (8.3 IU/l) and troponin I (1.14 ng/mL), both of which are indicative of ST-seegulation. However, there was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or wall motion abnormalities in the echocardiogram.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**History & Diagnosis:**  \n",
      "The patient was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to the elevated CKMB and troponin I levels. The appropriate acute coronary syndrome medications were prescribed, including amloidine 250 mg daily, which was effective in reducing chest pain on follow-up evaluation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Left Heart Catheterization:**  \n",
      "The following day, a left heart catheterization revealed normal coronary artery function with no significant wall motion abnormalities or left ventricular hypertrophy. The LAD (left atrial distal) flow was slow, as observed in the intracoronary adenosine challenge test, which normalized the TIMI frame count.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Followup:**  \n",
      "One month post-discharge, the patient reported that chest pain had been effectively eliminated, with no recurrent episodes of pressure-like chest pain or diaphoresis.  \n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to format this information into a medical report. Let me read through it again and break down the key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there's an 18-year-old woman with eczema history who presented after coitus. She had generalized urticaria, nasal congestion, secretions, conjunctivitis, and periorbital and labial oedema. No vaginal itching or burning was mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total IgE was slightly elevated at 350 KIU/L. There's some indication that there are allergens present because the MAST CLA test was negative. So, no specific allergies detected yet? Or maybe it's just a general sign?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there were historyamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva and sweat, and semen. All of those tests came out negative except for the partners' semen. The positive cell control (anti-IgE) test was also negative. So that means no IgE antibodies detected in the blood. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of sexual intercourse patterns after diagnosis:\n",
      "- First 6 months: condom wasn't used enough, close body contact caused urticaria, sneezing, conjunctivitis.\n",
      "- Then, she tried abstinence and slept apart for most of that period.\n",
      "- From 6 to 12 months: some body contact became possible (kissing/hugging), but still didn't cause severe symptoms. So maybe with the use of a condom and oral antihistamines, it could improve the situation?\n",
      "- In later years: Still used oral antihistamines before intercourse; but the condition was challenging on a regular basis by showing milder symptoms.\n",
      "- Skin prick test for the partners' semen found positive results at 10 mm diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't report any other sexual partners. So, this woman had her initial coitalization in a different setting where she wasn't using antihistamines, and it led to some issues after that, but without complications on her own. But with the same partners now, even when using antihistamines, she still faced challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to figure out how all these points fit into a medical report format. The user provided an example response with sections like Introduction, History of Condition, Prophylaxis and Response, Results from Allergen Tests, and Conclusion. That seems helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my task is to take this detailed information and structure it into the same sections. I need to make sure each section flows logically and covers all necessary points without being redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go through each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Introduction**: This sets the stage with the patient's history of eczema and her symptoms post-coitus. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **History of Condition**: Here, we list the key facts about the patient, including the elevated IgE, negative MAST CLA, etc. I need to present these clearly, perhaps using bullet points or numbered lists as in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prophylaxis and Response**: This section talks about her sexual history before diagnosis. She had poor contact, didn't use condoms much, used abstinence, but didn't show symptoms until later. The example includes points on early behavior, gradual improvement with condom use with antihistamines, challenges over time, and positive skin prick results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Results from Allergen Tests**: This dives into the historyamine release tests for different substances. All were negative except for the partners' semen, which was also negative in a positive cell control test. The elevated IgE doesn't indicate specific allergens detected yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes her sexual health, noting her challenges despite using antihistamines and the positive skin prick result. It's important to stress that while she had anaphylaxis to human plasma before diagnosis, it was likely a more general issue with IgE.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure each section is concise, uses clear headings, and includes all relevant data without being too verbose. Also, I need to use consistent terminology and ensure that the flow from introduction to conclusion makes sense as one cohesive report.\n",

       "      <td>Okay, so I need to help format a medical report using the SOAP notes outline as specified. First, I should understand what each section entails and ensure that all relevant information is included without missing anything.\\n\\nStarting with the Subjective section, the first heading is the \"Cheif Complain.\" This includes the patient's main symptoms, history of present illness, patient history, and a review of the systems. Looking at the provided information, the patient is a 17-year-old nonparous girl with a one-month pelvic mass diagnosis. She underwent several operations including a staging laparotomy, which I think falls under review of systems since that's part of treating the tumor.\\n\\nNext is \"History of Present Illness.\" This includes any pre-existing conditions or past illnesses that might affect her current symptoms. The patient wasn't mentioned for pre-existing conditions, but in the objective section, she did have a tumor diagnosis. So I should note that no comorbidities were specified beyond her current illness.\\n\\nThen comes \"Patient History,\" which is more detailed about her physical and emotional state. She's a 17-year-old nonparous girl with noticeable pelvic mass, underwent surgery, etc., but nothing specific beyond her age and the symptoms described. I should note that she's nonparous (unaffected by the paraplegic nerve), single sexual orientation, age 17, etc., but maybe too detailed for the format here.\\n\\nAfter patient history, the review of systems includes \"Systematic Review.\" This covers everything from imaging to histology. She was seen in a physical exam, had chest X-ray, performed laparoscopy, had CT scan, and post-operative exams. I should list each of these steps, noting that there were no comorbidities besides the current illness.\\n\\nMoving on to the Objective section, starting with \"Objective Data.\" The patient's vital signs include her age (17 years), normal blood pressure (not specified but perhaps 120/80 mmHg typical for a 17-year-old?), heart rate (not given). She had chest X-ray with normal findings. Laparoscopy was performed, and the tissue showed an immature teratoma. She had CT scan with a radiologist's report showing masses. Postoperative histology revealed a mature teratoma. Postoperative complete excision of the tumor.\\n\\nThere was no comorbidity noted beyond her current illness, so I should include that as well.\\n\\nThe objective data found during the patient visit includes vital signs (age, BP), chest X-ray findings, laparoscopy results, CT scan details, histology findings, and imaging findings.\\n\\nIn the Assessment section, starting with \"Problem.\" The patient has a left ovarian tumor, which is a known problem in women of reproductive age. She was diagnosed at 2007, so her age is important here. It's also noted that she underwent several treatments including a staging laparotomy and chemotherapy, but since those are after the diagnosis, maybe they fall under treatment or follow-up.\\n\\nFor differential diagnosis, the possible diagnosis would be another ovarian tumor in the future, given her age and medical history. There could also be other ovarian conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is common in reproductive women with tumors. Maybe some cancers from other tissues, though that's less likely with a one-month history.\\n\\nIn the Plan section, any further treatment or actions needed are listed.

       "      <td>A 55-year-old Vietnamese male with no significant past medical history presents to a local community hospital emergency department because of abdominal pain and distention of two-week duration. The abdominal pain was generalized, described as cramping, present throughout the day, had no association with meals, and was getting progressively worse. The patient also reported nausea and vomiting clear material. He denied any recent fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, change in bowel habits, sick contacts, and consumption of raw food. In addition, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash. After immigration from Vietnam 11 years ago, his only travel outside the USA was back to his homeland one year prior to this illness. The patient was not taking any prescribed or over the counter medications or herbal compounds and denied any allergies. His physical examination showed no skin rash or jaundice, cardiopulmonary examination showed no abnormality, and the abdomen was moderately distended, with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, and moderate ascites. There was no hepatomegaly or abdominal mass.\\nIn the emergency department, a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were significant for an elevated white blood count of 15.400 with 36% eosinophils. Abdominal and pelvis computer tomography (CT) showed moderate ascites with thickening of the gastric antrum and proximal small bowel (). The patient was admitted to the general medical service and placed on bowel rest and intravenous fluid hydration. Further he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which demonstrated mild duodenitis and biopsies demonstrated mild nonspecific acute inflammation predominantly lymphocytic. Stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. In addition, a screen for Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora, and Sarcocystis did not reveal evidence of recent infection. Over several days, the patient's abdominal pain improved, diet was advanced, and he was discharged home with an empiric trial of albendazole for a presumptive diagnosis of parasitic infection.\\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient was readmitted with worsening abdominal pain. Physical examination showed increased abdomen distention. Repeated blood counts and serum biochemical tests demonstrated an increase in white cell count of 17.100/mL with 71% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count of 12.141/弮l with normal upper limit &lt;450) (). Liver function tests continued to be within normal limits. Serum IgE level was elevated at 548 IU/mL (normal &lt; 180). Repeat stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. Furthermore, immunologic studies for Toxocara, Trichinella, Strongyloides, Filiaria, Schistosoma, Echinococcus, and Cysticerus were negative.\\nRepeated EGD was nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed no myelo- or lymphoproliferative findings. Serum 帣-2-microglobulin and LDH were 2.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.8??.0) and 170 U/L (normal: 80??00), respectively. Ultrasound guided abdominal paracentesis showed WBC count of 6600/mL, 95% of which were eosinophils (), LDH 284 mg/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL (simultaneous serum albumin 4.1 g/dL). In order to exclude small bowel lymphoma, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with full-thickness biopsy of an inflamed portion of the jejunum. This revealed skipped areas of hyperemia and discoloration involving the small intestine and to a lesser degree the colon in addition to yellow-green ascites (). Histopathological evaluation showed marked eosinophilic infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa with concomitant mild acute inflammatory reaction (). There was no evidence of malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasites.\\nThe constellation of clinical presentation and histopathological findings were suggestive of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Subsequently, the patient was started on oral prednisone (20 mg/day). Two weeks later and with noticeable symptomatic improvement, the prednisone was tapered over a two-week period. After completion of steroids, the patient's abdominal pain and physical finding of ascites completely resolved and a peripheral blood count revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 300/弮l (nL &lt; 450). Furthermore, IgE level dropped to 105 IU/mL and CT imaging of the abdominal and pelvis showed complete resolution of the ascites and small bowel thickening. Four months have elapsed since treatment and the patient remains asymptomatic on no medications.</td>\n",

It should have the main complaints and history of the illness. The patient is 55 years old from Vietnam who's presented with abdominal pain for two weeks. He also mentioned nausea and vomiting. I don't see any signs of diabetes, heart problems, or other chronic conditions mentioned here.\\n\\nNext, the Objective section includes vital signs, physical exam findings, lab results, and imaging. His blood test showed elevated white blood cells (WBC) at 15.400/10^9/L with some eosinophils. The physical exam didn't show any abnormalities except for slight tenderness and distension in the abdomen. The CT scan was categorized as moderate ascites, which is good because it means there might be swelling but not huge problems.\\n\\nLooking at the lab results, white blood cells were elevated and somewhat abnormal. There was no infection or anemia noted from the tests. The imaging results confirmed moderate ascites, which supports the diagnosis.\\n\\nFor Assessment, I need to list any known or suspected diagnoses. The patient didn't report any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any signs that could indicate a serious underlying health issue. The main thing is the elevated WBC count and the physical exam findings. Since there's no evidence of diabetes or other chronic conditions mentioned, these can be excluded.\\n\\nIn the Plan section, it should list further treatments. He initially took albendazole for parasitic infection but then the doctor tried prednisone and steroids. After that, everything resolved well, so he doesn't need any more treatment.\\n\\nI also need to make sure all the information is included without repetition, using only the data provided. Each section starts with a clear number under Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, each having their respective subheadings.

       "      <td>Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to format this medical report correctly. Let me go through each part step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the Subjective section needs a few subsections: Cheif Complaint, History of Present Illness, Patient History, Review of Systems, and Current Medications/Allergies. The patient's main complaint is chest pain at rest, so that should be his chief complaint. He also mentioned shortness of breath and diaphoresis, which are symptoms associated with chest pain.\\n\\nNext, the History section will list all known medical history items from before this case. That includes squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base six years ago and then the current incident. I need to make sure each item is clearly listed and numbered for easy reference.\\n\\nThe Patient History should detail the patient's symptoms and any lab test results. He reported chest pain at rest, short breath, diaphoresis, EKG showing T-wave inversion, prolonged QT interval, elevated CKMB and troponin I, echocardiogram showing normal LVF, left heart catheterization showing slow flow in LAD, and the adenosine challenge normalized.\\n\\nMoving on to the Review of Systems section. The primary system affected is the heart, as he had chest pain. I need to list any known heart conditions from before this case but also check for new ones. He didn't have ST-segment elevation or any other cardiology issues since he was in acute CYI.\\n\\nCurrent Medications include amlodipine 2.5 mg, and if there are allergies mentioned, like anconitum or something else that might affect the medication's safety profile.\\n\\nNow for Objective: vital signs were taken (BP at rest, HR) and results came back normal with no weight loss or gain, so it was steady-state oxygen. Blood test wasn't done because he wasn't on any medications, but I know the usual order is to do a lab. For physical exam findings, chest pain was present but not significant, followed by short breath and diaphoresis, EKG showed T wave inversion, QT prolongation.\\n\\nCardiac enzymes were elevated, which matched what's typical for acute CYI. No irregular leads or wall motion issues, so the cardiology part was normal.\\n\\nImaging done: transthoraciqueoiardiogram was normal with no abnormalities, and then an intracoronary adenosine challenge showed normalized TIMI frame counts. So that's within the normal range of 1-3 for a normal heart valve.\\n\\nThen on follow-up, he reported chest pain free. That's good news because it means no further complications from this case.\\n\\nPutting it all together in SOAP format: I need to make sure each section is labeled correctly with numbers and subheadings as specified. The format needs to be consistent, so I should use the same numbering for each section within a heading. Also, ensure that all necessary data like EKG results, cardioresults, imaging findings are included.\\n\\nI should also double-check if any new medications or allergies were mentioned. In this case, no new medications except amlodipine, and no other allergies. Then in the Assessment section, identify the primary problem as myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), list the diagnosis from most important to least, which would be NSTEMI followed by acute coronary syndrome. The differential diagnoses should include CAD, CHF, ST-segment elevation, etc., but since there's no CAD history or ST elevation, it's narrowed down.\\n\\nIn Plan, I'll note that further action includes continuing amlodipine and follow up with the cardiologist.\\n\\nFinally, ensure all data is correctly formatted without any markdown and placed within triple backticks as specified. No extra explanations unless requested, just a clear SOAP report.</td>\n",

The Phadia Immunocap and the Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test-chemiluminescent Assay (MAST CLA) test panels were negative []. Histamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva, sweat and semen were performed. The histamine release test procedure includes histamine release from peripheral whole-blood basophils, in a glass fiber prepared microtiter plate, by challenging 25 弮L heparinised whole blood with 25 弮L buffered allergen dilutions in various concentrations for 60 minutes at 37簞C. The assay is calibrated by a two-point standard curve and a positive cell control (anti-IgE) []. The test results are given as negative or positive. Histamine release tests for latex and for the partners saliva and sweat were negative, whereas the test was positive for the partners semen. The partners sweat, saliva, and semen were also tested in blood from a healthy control person, and these tests were all negative.

Even close body contact such as kissing and hugging would cause acute urticaria, sneezing, and conjunctivitis despite daily intake of oral antihistamines, however, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions did not occur. Sexual intercourse was only possible on prednisolone 25 mg/day; so, the couple opted for abstinence and slept in separate rooms during most of that period. Between 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis was established, gradually, body contact became possible, and some months later with the use of a condom and on premedication with oral antihistamines coitus was possible without associated symptoms. During the second and third years after diagnosis the patient would still use oral antihistamines prior to intercourse several times per week; however, the condition was challenged on a regular basis by the couple showing milder and milder symptoms. Five years after the diagnosis incidental episodes of provocation caused by condom defects and intended challenges without condom were not associated with significant symptoms. A skin prick test in the patient for the partners semen at that time found a positive reaction of a diameter of 10 (positive control 7) mm.

Other tumour markers were not performed due to financial constraint. An intraoperative frozen section revealed immature teratoma and she underwent fertility sparing surgery. A staging laparotomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and infracolic omentectomy was performed. Postoperative histology report revealed mature teratoma with focal area of immature teratoma of the left ovary. There was no malignant cell infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. Histology revealed immature teratoma grade I, FIGO stage 1a. Despite being advised for close surveillance, she defaulted followup after 6 months postoperative.\\nOne year later, she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and resought medical advice. She developed radiological recurrence of pelvic mass with a raised serum CA-125 of 180 IU/L following which she completed 6 courses of systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel). After chemotherapy, the tumour marker normalised (<35 IU/L) but the pelvic mass progressively increased in size. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed presence of bilateral large adnexal masses with infiltration into uterus and also possibly to the sigmoid colon. Growing teratoma syndrome was suspected. She underwent staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumour. Full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was done. Postoperative CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no residual disease. Histology of excised mass revealed mature teratoma with no presence of immature cells. The patient remained with no recurrence at the time of this report, which is 8 months after the second operation for GTS.   \n",
       "1  A 55-year-old Vietnamese male with no significant past medical history presents to a local community hospital emergency department because of abdominal pain and distention of two-week duration. The abdominal pain was generalized, described as cramping, present throughout the day, had no association with meals, and was getting progressively worse. The patient also reported nausea and vomiting clear material. He denied any recent fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, change in bowel habits, sick contacts, and consumption of raw food. In addition, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash. After immigration from Vietnam 11 years ago, his only travel outside the USA was back to his homeland one year prior to this illness. The patient was not taking any prescribed or over the counter medications or herbal compounds and denied any allergies. His physical examination showed no skin rash or jaundice, cardiopulmonary examination showed no abnormality, and the abdomen was moderately distended, with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, and moderate ascites. There was no hepatomegaly or abdominal mass.\\nIn the emergency department, a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were significant for an elevated white blood count of 15.400 with 36% eosinophils. Abdominal and pelvis computer tomography (CT) showed moderate ascites with thickening of the gastric antrum and proximal small bowel (). The patient was admitted to the general medical service and placed on bowel rest and intravenous fluid hydration. Further he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which demonstrated mild duodenitis and biopsies demonstrated mild nonspecific acute inflammation predominantly lymphocytic. Stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. In addition, a screen for Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora, and Sarcocystis did not reveal evidence of recent infection. Over several days, the patient's abdominal pain improved, diet was advanced, and he was discharged home with an empiric trial of albendazole for a presumptive diagnosis of parasitic infection.\\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient was readmitted with worsening abdominal pain. Physical examination showed increased abdomen distention. Repeated blood counts and serum biochemical tests demonstrated an increase in white cell count of 17.100/mL with 71% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count of 12.141/弮l with normal upper limit <450) (). Liver function tests continued to be within normal limits. Serum IgE level was elevated at 548 IU/mL (normal < 180). Repeat stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. Furthermore, immunologic studies for Toxocara, Trichinella, Strongyloides, Filiaria, Schistosoma, Echinococcus, and Cysticerus were negative.\\nRepeated EGD was nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed no myelo- or lymphoproliferative findings. Serum 帣-2-microglobulin and LDH were 2.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.8??.0) and 170 U/L (normal: 80??00), respectively. Ultrasound guided abdominal paracentesis showed WBC count of 6600/mL, 95% of which were eosinophils (), LDH 284 mg/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL (simultaneous serum albumin 4.1 g/dL). In order to exclude small bowel lymphoma, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with full-thickness biopsy of an inflamed portion of the jejunum. This revealed skipped areas of hyperemia and discoloration involving the small intestine and to a lesser degree the colon in addition to yellow-green ascites (). Histopathological evaluation showed marked eosinophilic infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa with concomitant mild acute inflammatory reaction (). There was no evidence of malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasites.\\nThe constellation of clinical presentation and histopathological findings were suggestive of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Subsequently, the patient was started on oral prednisone (20 mg/day). Two weeks later and with noticeable symptomatic improvement, the prednisone was tapered over a two-week period. After completion of steroids, the patient's abdominal pain and physical finding of ascites completely resolved and a peripheral blood count revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 300/弮l (nL < 450). Furthermore, IgE level dropped to 105 IU/mL and CT imaging of the abdominal and pelvis showed complete resolution of the ascites and small bowel thickening. Four months have elapsed since treatment and the patient remains asymptomatic on no medications.   \n",

The chest pain was described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, 8/10 in severity, and radiated down his left arm. Upon presentation, vital signs were stable, cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits, and the electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no ST/T-waves changes. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle function and no wall motion abnormalities. Of note, the patient had a similar presentation and ER course two weeks prior.\\nDue to the fact that the patient continued to have 8/10 chest pain during his hospital stay, coronary angiogram was ultimately done. The angiogram showed normal coronary arteries without evidence of coronary vasospasm or an existing myocardial bridge. Slow flow, however, was noted in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). An intracoronary adenosine challenge was done and showed normalization of the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) frame count (). The patient was given the diagnosis of coronary slow flow phenomenon and started on dipyridamole 50 mg three times a day and discharged home.\\nOn six-month followup, the patient reported that he had been chest-pain-free. Shortly after his six-month followup, the patient ran out of his medicine and again began to experience chest pain. Once the patient was placed back on his dipyridamole, he became chest-pain-free.   \n",

The patient presented with a single episode of chest pain at rest described as pressure-like and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Admission EKG revealed T-wave inversion in the anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval (). Cardiac enzymes were also noted to be elevated (CKMB 8.3 IU/l and troponin I 1.14 ng/mL). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with no wall motion abnormalities or left ventricular hypertrophy. A diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was made, and the patient was started on the appropriate acute coronary syndrome medications. Left heart catheterization was done the following day and revealed normal coronary arteries with slow flow noted in LAD. An intracoronary adenosine challenge was done that showed normalization of the TIMI frame count (). The patient was given the diagnosis of coronary slow flow and started on amlodipine 2.5 mg daily. On 6-month followup, the patient reports that he has been chest-pain-free.   \n",

There was no vaginal itching or burning.\\nTotal IgE was slightly elevated, 350 (0??50) KIU/L. The Phadia Immunocap and the Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test-chemiluminescent Assay (MAST CLA) test panels were negative []. Histamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva, sweat and semen were performed. The histamine release test procedure includes histamine release from peripheral whole-blood basophils, in a glass fiber prepared microtiter plate, by challenging 25 弮L heparinised whole blood with 25 弮L buffered allergen dilutions in various concentrations for 60 minutes at 37簞C. The assay is calibrated by a two-point standard curve and a positive cell control (anti-IgE) []. The test results are given as negative or positive. Histamine release tests for latex and for the partners saliva and sweat were negative, whereas the test was positive for the partners semen. The partners sweat, saliva, and semen were also tested in blood from a healthy control person, and these tests were all negative. Furthermore, a skin prick test was performed in the patient finding a positive reaction with a diameter of 12 (positive control 5) mm for the partners semen. Skin prick tests with the partners semen were also performed in two healthy women finding negative results.\\nDuring the first 6 months after a diagnosis of anaphylaxis to human seminal plasma was established, condom usage was not sufficient for prophylaxis. Even close body contact such as kissing and hugging would cause acute urticaria, sneezing, and conjunctivitis despite daily intake of oral antihistamines, however, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions did not occur. Sexual intercourse was only possible on prednisolone 25 mg/day; so, the couple opted for abstinence and slept in separate rooms during most of that period. Between 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis was established, gradually, body contact became possible, and some months later with the use of a condom and on premedication with oral antihistamines coitus was possible without associated symptoms. During the second and third years after diagnosis the patient would still use oral antihistamines prior to intercourse several times per week; however, the condition was challenged on a regular basis by the couple showing milder and milder symptoms. Five years after the diagnosis incidental episodes of provocation caused by condom defects and intended challenges without condom were not associated with significant symptoms. A skin prick test in the patient for the partners semen at that time found a positive reaction of a diameter of 10 (positive control 7) mm. The patient did not report any other sexual partners.   \n",

The patient was diagnosed with a coronary slow flow phenomenon and began dipyridamole 50 mg every three days.\\n- **Current Medications/Allergies**: No allergies were mentioned. The diagnosis does not involve complications following treatment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Objective**\\n- **Vital Signs**: Stable, indicating normal cardiac biomarkers.\\n- **Physical Exam Findings**: No signs of malignancy; no chest pain after ER course was observed.\\n- **Labs and Imaging Results**:\\n  - EKG: Normal results.\\n  - echocardiogram: Left ventricular function normal; no wall motion abnormalities.\\n  - angiogram: Normal coronary arteries; no bridge in myocardial.\\n- **Other Findings**: Likely done elsewhere, consistent with the findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Assessment**\\n- **Problem**: Chest pain described as 8/10. The patient experienced chest pain again after ER treatment but was discharged home without chest pain again. No complications were noted post-treatment.\\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Likely coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions, possibly from a prior ER course.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Plan**\\n- **No Further Actions Needed**: Continue with the current plan of dipyridamole 50 mg every three days.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis structured format ensures clarity and consistency in presenting the medical information as per SOAP notes guidelines.   \n",

       "0  Okay, so I need to help format a medical report using the SOAP notes outline as specified. First, I should understand what each section entails and ensure that all relevant information is included without missing anything.\\n\\nStarting with the Subjective section, the first heading is the \"Cheif Complain.\" This includes the patient's main symptoms, history of present illness, patient history, and a review of the systems. Looking at the provided information, the patient is a 17-year-old nonparous girl with a one-month pelvic mass diagnosis. She underwent several operations including a staging laparotomy, which I think falls under review of systems since that's part of treating the tumor.\\n\\nNext is \"History of Present Illness.\" This includes any pre-existing conditions or past illnesses that might affect her current symptoms. The patient wasn't mentioned for pre-existing conditions, but in the objective section, she did have a tumor diagnosis. So I should note that no comorbidities were specified beyond her current illness.\\n\\nThen comes \"Patient History,\" which is more detailed about her physical and emotional state. She's a 17-year-old nonparous girl with noticeable pelvic mass, underwent surgery, etc., but nothing specific beyond her age and the symptoms described. I should note that she's nonparous (unaffected by the paraplegic nerve), single sexual orientation, age 17, etc., but maybe too detailed for the format here.\\n\\nAfter patient history, the review of systems includes \"Systematic Review.\" This covers everything from imaging to histology. She was seen in a physical exam, had chest X-ray, performed laparoscopy, had CT scan, and post-operative exams. I should list each of these steps, noting that there were no comorbidities besides the current illness.\\n\\nMoving on to the Objective section, starting with \"Objective Data.\" The patient's vital signs include her age (17 years), normal blood pressure (not specified but perhaps 120/80 mmHg typical for a 17-year-old?), heart rate (not given). She had chest X-ray with normal findings. Laparoscopy was performed, and the tissue showed an immature teratoma. She had CT scan with a radiologist's report showing masses. Postoperative histology revealed a mature teratoma. Postoperative complete excision of the tumor.\\n\\nThere was no comorbidity noted beyond her current illness, so I should include that as well.\\n\\nThe objective data found during the patient visit includes vital signs (age, BP), chest X-ray findings, laparoscopy results, CT scan details, histology findings, and imaging findings.\\n\\nIn the Assessment section, starting with \"Problem.\" The patient has a left ovarian tumor, which is a known problem in women of reproductive age. She was diagnosed at 2007, so her age is important here. It's also noted that she underwent several treatments including a staging laparotomy and chemotherapy, but since those are after the diagnosis, maybe they fall under treatment or follow-up.\\n\\nFor differential diagnosis, the possible diagnosis would be another ovarian tumor in the future, given her age and medical history. There could also be other ovarian conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is common in reproductive women with tumors. Maybe some cancers from other tissues, though that's less likely with a one-month history.\\n\\nIn the Plan section, any further treatment or actions needed are listed. She was initially advised for close surveillance but defaulted followup after 6 months postoperative. Now she's seeing another course of chemotherapy and has undergone surgery again for GTS, which is part of treatment, not necessarily a separate plan.\\n\\nI need to make sure each section follows the SOAP format: Subjective - Cheif Complain; Objective - Objective Data; Assessment - Problem, Differential Diagnosis; Plan - Notes. Also, I should include all relevant information like her age, the history of illness, physical examination findings, imaging results, and treatment details without missing any steps.\\n\\nI think that covers everything. Now, I'll structure it according to each section as per the SOAP outline provided earlier.  \n",

First, let me understand what a SOAP note is. From what I remember, SOAP stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. Each section has specific subheadings.\\n\\nStarting with the Subjective section. It should have the main complaints and history of the illness. The patient is 55 years old from Vietnam who's presented with abdominal pain for two weeks. He also mentioned nausea and vomiting. I don't see any signs of diabetes, heart problems, or other chronic conditions mentioned here.\\n\\nNext, the Objective section includes vital signs, physical exam findings, lab results, and imaging. His blood test showed elevated white blood cells (WBC) at 15.400/10^9/L with some eosinophils. The physical exam didn't show any abnormalities except for slight tenderness and distension in the abdomen. The CT scan was categorized as moderate ascites, which is good because it means there might be swelling but not huge problems.\\n\\nLooking at the lab results, white blood cells were elevated and somewhat abnormal. There was no infection or anemia noted from the tests. The imaging results confirmed moderate ascites, which supports the diagnosis.\\n\\nFor Assessment, I need to list any known or suspected diagnoses. The patient didn't report any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any signs that could indicate a serious underlying health issue. The main thing is the elevated WBC count and the physical exam findings. Since there's no evidence of diabetes or other chronic conditions mentioned, these can be excluded.\\n\\nIn the Plan section, it should list further treatments. He initially took albendazole for parasitic infection but then the doctor tried prednisone and steroids. After that, everything resolved well, so he doesn't need any more treatment.\\n\\nI also need to make sure all the information is included without repetition, using only the data provided. Each section starts with a clear number under Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, each having their respective subheadings. I'll structure it as per the user's example but ensure there are no extra details.  \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Okay, so I have this medical report to format using the SOAP notes outline. Let me read through what's given first.\\n\\nThe first case is a 43-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He comes in with chest pain described as 8/10 on an 8-10 scale. The EKG shows normal results, but there are no ST-T waves. When he had ER treatment two weeks ago, chest pain was observed again.\\n\\nThe doctor did a transthoracic echocardiogram and found normal left ventricular function without wall motion. He then had a coronary angiogram, which showed normal arteries without vasospasm or bridge in myocardial. Slow flow was noted on the LAD. Intracoronary adenosine challenge normalized TIMI counts. He started dipyridamole 50 mg every three days and came home.\\n\\nOn six months later, he had chest-pain-free again. After running out of medicine, he began chest pain again after starting dipyridamole.\\n\\nNow, I need to format this into a medical report following the SOAP notes outline as specified by the user.\\n\\nFirst heading is Subjective, with subheadings:Chief Complaint, History of Present Illness, Patient History, Review of Systems, Current Medications/Allergies.\\n\\nThen Objective includes vital signs, physical exam findings, lab results, imaging, etc.\\n\\nSecond is Objective data like vital signs, EKG, echocardiogram, angiogram, etc.\\n\\nThird is Assessment with Problem and Differential Diagnosis. Problem lists the diagnosis from most important to least, then differential.\\n\\nFourth is Plan for further treatment or actions.\\n\\nI need to make sure I only use the provided information without adding anything extra. Let me structure each section accordingly.\\n\\nChief Complaint: Chest pain described as 8/10. ER course was done two weeks ago with chest pain again.\\n\\nHistory: Patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, with prior chest pain from ER course. Now he has chest pain again.\\n\\nPatient History: 43-year-old with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chest pain two times before ER course.\\n\\nReview of Systems: EKG normal; echocardiogram shows no ST-T waves; angiogram shows normal. No vasospasm or bridge in myocardial; LAD had slow flow. Adenosine challenge normalized TIMI counts. Diagnosed with coronary slow flow phenomenon. Started dipyridamole 50 mg every three days.\\n\\nCurrent Medications/Allergies: No allergies mentioned. Diagnosed with no complications post treatment.\\n\\nObjective Data:\\n- Vital Signs: Stable, normal cardiac biomarkers.\\n- EKG: Normal results.\\n- echocardiogram: Left ventricle function normal; no wall motion abnormalities.\\n- angiogram: Normal coronary arteries; no bridge in myocardial.\\n- Physical exam findings: No signs of malignancy. No chest pain after ER course.\\n- Other labs: Not provided here, but likely done elsewhere.\\n\\nImaging results: echocardiogram and angiogram as above.\\n\\nAssessment:\\nProblem: Chest pain described as 8/10; no complications post treatment (chest pain free). Diagnosed with normal EKG, normal echocardiogram, etc.\\nDifferential Diagnosis: coronary artery disease, possibly coronary heart failure, other cardiac conditions. Likely from a previous ER course.\\n\\nPlan for further action: No additional treatments needed. Continue with current plan.\\n\\nI think that covers all sections of the SOAP notes outline. I need to make sure each section is clearly labeled and that no information is added beyond what's provided in the case report.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to format this medical report correctly. Let me go through each part step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the Subjective section needs a few subsections: Cheif Complaint, History of Present Illness, Patient History, Review of Systems, and Current Medications/Allergies. The patient's main complaint is chest pain at rest, so that should be his chief complaint. He also mentioned shortness of breath and diaphoresis, which are symptoms associated with chest pain.\\n\\nNext, the History section will list all known medical history items from before this case. That includes squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base six years ago and then the current incident. I need to make sure each item is clearly listed and numbered for easy reference.\\n\\nThe Patient History should detail the patient's symptoms and any lab test results. He reported chest pain at rest, short breath, diaphoresis, EKG showing T-wave inversion, prolonged QT interval, elevated CKMB and troponin I, echocardiogram showing normal LVF, left heart catheterization showing slow flow in LAD, and the adenosine challenge normalized.\\n\\nMoving on to the Review of Systems section. The primary system affected is the heart, as he had chest pain. I need to list any known heart conditions from before this case but also check for new ones. He didn't have ST-segment elevation or any other cardiology issues since he was in acute CYI.\\n\\nCurrent Medications include amlodipine 2.5 mg, and if there are allergies mentioned, like anconitum or something else that might affect the medication's safety profile.\\n\\nNow for Objective: vital signs were taken (BP at rest, HR) and results came back normal with no weight loss or gain, so it was steady-state oxygen. Blood test wasn't done because he wasn't on any medications, but I know the usual order is to do a lab. For physical exam findings, chest pain was present but not significant, followed by short breath and diaphoresis, EKG showed T wave inversion, QT prolongation.\\n\\nCardiac enzymes were elevated, which matched what's typical for acute CYI. No irregular leads or wall motion issues, so the cardiology part was normal.\\n\\nImaging done: transthoraciqueoiardiogram was normal with no abnormalities, and then an intracoronary adenosine challenge showed normalized TIMI frame counts. So that's within the normal range of 1-3 for a normal heart valve.\\n\\nThen on follow-up, he reported chest pain free. That's good news because it means no further complications from this case.\\n\\nPutting it all together in SOAP format: I need to make sure each section is labeled correctly with numbers and subheadings as specified. The format needs to be consistent, so I should use the same numbering for each section within a heading. Also, ensure that all necessary data like EKG results, cardioresults, imaging findings are included.\\n\\nI should also double-check if any new medications or allergies were mentioned. In this case, no new medications except amlodipine, and no other allergies. Then in the Assessment section, identify the primary problem as myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), list the diagnosis from most important to least, which would be NSTEMI followed by acute coronary syndrome. The differential diagnoses should include CAD, CHF, ST-segment elevation, etc., but since there's no CAD history or ST elevation, it's narrowed down.\\n\\nIn Plan, I'll note that further action includes continuing amlodipine and follow up with the cardiologist.\\n\\nFinally, ensure all data is correctly formatted without any markdown and placed within triple backticks as specified. No extra explanations unless requested, just a clear SOAP report.  \n",

Let me start by understanding what each section should include based on the initial instructions.\\n\\nFirst, the Subjective section needs four subheadings: chief complaint, history of present illness, patient history, and review of systems. The objective section includes vital signs, findings during physical exams, lab results, imaging, and objective data. The assessment has problem and differential diagnosis sections, and the plan includes notes for treatment or actions.\\n\\nLooking at the provided narrative, it's quite detailed, especially regarding anaphylaxis complications and how they progressed over time. I need to extract relevant medical terms, symptoms, and data points from this text into each section.\\n\\nFor Subjective, starting with the chief complaint: the patient reports episodes of generalized urticaria, nasal congestion, secretions, conjunctivitis, periorbital and labial oedema after coitus. Then I need to gather more about her past diagnosis—eczema, maybe complications from that. Her medical history should include current anaphylaxis issues, the presence of IgE, and the results of MAST CLA tests being negative.\\n\\nIn patient history, I'll list any medications she's on, including oral antihistamines, and note when they started taking them. Also, mention any allergies like eczema, though it seems to have been cleared up after coitus.\\n\\nUnder review of systems, the system status would include systemic symptoms, organ systems affected (like kidneys, lungs, etc.), and the patient's overall health—like weight, blood pressure, maybe kidney function based on MAST CLA being negative.\\n\\nMoving to Objective: vital signs include body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate. For physical exams, I'll note if she had any injuries or if there was a burn. Labs should include total IgE and MAST CLA results. Imaging doesn't seem needed here since oedema is mentioned but not imaging findings.\\n\\nThen objective data would be the skin prick test result (positive 12mm), her age, etc.\\n\\nAssessment: The problem section will outline anaphylaxis as a significant complication, listing specific symptoms and listing agents with the differential diagnosis including eczema, allergies from IgE, and complications like oedema. The differential diagnosis section should also mention any other possible conditions contributing to the anaphylaxis.\\n\\nPlan would include further treatments, like antihistamines or complications like kidney issues (if MAST CLA was negative), possibly adjusting antihistamines in labs if results change. Also, note any medical actions like switching medications or guidelines for retesting.\\n\\nI need to make sure each section is consistent with the SOAP format and includes all necessary details without missing anything from the narrative. Let me organize each part step by step.  "
