      "First, the patient's presentation: she was 17 years old, nonparous (non-pregnant), with a one-month history of a pelvic mass. That’s pretty significant because non-paranoids usually don’t have such a high risk of parity. They might have more concerning signs like nausea or vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor in 2007. The CA-125 test showed a raised serum level, which is concerning. The patient wasn’t able to do the financial checkup, so she probably can't discuss other aspects of her medical history beyond what’s given here.\n",
      "\n",
      "An intraoperative frozen section showed an immature teratoma, and she had fertility sparing surgery. I should include that. Fertility sparing is a standard surgical procedure for ovarian tumors in cases where there's some concern about whether the tumor might return or spread laterally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The treatment involved several procedures: staging laparotomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy (which looks at the abdomen and pelvis), peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and an infracolic omentectomy. Each of these is a standard procedure for managing ovarian tumors, especially when they are localized.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the surgery, the postoperative histology report found a mature teratoma with focal areas of immature teratomas in the left ovary. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes, which is important for determining whether the tumor has spread beyond those areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "She wasn’t supposed to be closely surveillance until six months after the first operation. She defaulted and went ahead, but her follow-up after that didn’t show any recurrence yet. The CT scan showed no residual disease, and the histology confirmed a mature teratoma with no immature cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the next year: she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and decided for medical advice again. She developed CA-125 raised levels post-chemotherapy, which was concerning because her tumor marker levels normalized. The pelvic masses showed some recurrence with larger size. CT scan revealed bilateral large adnexal masses involving the uterus and possibly the sigmoid colon.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was suspicion of growing teratoma syndrome, which sounds like the tumors are interfering with each other, maybe causing a new growth. She had staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumor. Full pelvic lymphadenectomy was done as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Postoperative CT scan showed no residual disease, histology confirmed a matureterima, but without any signs of further infiltration. So she was safe from recurrence at this time.\n",

      "The patient is a 17-year-old nonparous girl who presented with a one-month history of a noticeable pelvic mass. She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor on January 15, 2007. Despite having the ability to discuss her medical history due to the lack of other concerns, she chose to proceed unopposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Plan**\n",
      "The patient underwent several surgical procedures:\n",
      "- **Staging Laparotomy**: To localize the tumor and remove it.\n",
      "- **Left Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: To visualize the abdomen and pelvis.\n",
      "- **Peritoneal Cytology**: To examine the peritoneal cavity.\n",
      "- **Pelvic Lymph Node Sampling**: To assess the extent of lymphoid involvement.\n",
      "- **Infracolic Omentectomy**: To remove any small masses present in the pelvic bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Outcome**\n",
      "After the surgery, the postoperative histology report revealed a mature left ovary tumor with focal areas of immature teratomas. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. The tumor cells were FIGO stage 1a and grade I according to FIGO staging.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Follow-Up**\n",
      "One year later, she presented again following radiological recurrence in pelvic mass and her CA-125 levels increased to 180 IU/L due to chemotherapy. She underwent complete excision of the tumor and full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The postoperative CT scan revealed no residual disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "At this time, there was no recurrence at the report date, which is eight months after the second surgery for GTS (Growing Teratomics and Solid tumors). All findings were consistent with a localized, FIGO stage 1a, grade I tumor.\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this task. The user provided a lot of medical information about a patient who went from presenting with abdominal pain for two weeks to being discharged with a diagnosis of parasitic infections like Cryptosporidium. Then it became worse again after two days, and they needed more treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the main steps here are to create a medical report based on this information. The user wants me to translate that into a proper medical format consistently. So I need to structure it with clear sections like history, physical exam, findings, differential diagnoses, treatment plan, and conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll start by collecting all the patient's details—age, demographics, past history, presentation. Then move on to physical exam findings: abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss. Next, the differential diagnoses—I need to list possible causes like parasitic infections, gastrointestinal issues from other causes (like C. fumigansqueas), and things like C. elegans or Leptospirosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that, I'll outline the treatment plan based on each differential. The initial treatment is prednisone, which seems appropriate for pain management. Then steroids are given to reduce inflammation. Praziquantel (albendazole) should be used to treat parasitic infections if any are present. Lastly, they consider a bariatric surgery for more significant issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the conclusion, I'll summarize how the treatment plan addressed the patient's condition effectively. Maybe include reassurance that the patient is doing well and offer further support options like follow-up or rehabilitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure each section flows into the next, using consistent terminology and structure. Also, I have to avoid any personal pronouns or names, just stick to the facts provided. The user also emphasized consistency in responses, so each part of the report should align without exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should watch out for specific terms like \"bowel sounds\" vs. \"bailey's test,\" but I can keep it simple as long as it's clear from context. Also, note that after discharge, there was a trial of albendazole, which is important to mention since they used that treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the goal is to present all this information in an organized, clear manner that other healthcare professionals could use directly. It's crucial to be precise with medical terminology and ensure each part builds upon the previous one logically.\n",

      "A 55-year-old Vietnamese male presents to a local emergency room after experiencing generalized abdominal pain for two weeks. The patient described cramping, generalized onset, and progressive worsening with no connection to meals. Pain persisted throughout the day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting ( Clear material). No significant recent symptoms or associations were noted, including fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bowel habits, sick contacts, raw food consumption, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash.\n",

      "A 43-year-old man presented with chest pain described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, 8/10 in severity, radiating down his left arm. Vital signs were stable, cardiac biomarkers within normal limits, and the EKG showed no ST/T-waves changes. The echocardiogram revealed normal ventricular function and no wall motion abnormalities.\n",

      "**Present Examination Findings**\n",
      "Upon presentation, chest pain was characterized as moderate in severity (8/10). Detailed examination revealed normal vital signs. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed normal left ventricle function and no evidence of wall motion abnormalities or coronary vasospasm. Two weeks prior, similar chest pain and ER course were reported.\n",

      "**Detailed Findings from Tests**\n",
      "Chronic cardiokymography further identified normal coronary arteries without evidence of coronary vasospasm or myocardial bridge. Slow flow was noted in the LAD, and an intracoronary adenosine challenge revealed normalization of TIMI frame counts.\n",

      "Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to format this information into a medical report. Let me read through it again and break down the key points.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there's an 18-year-old woman with eczema history who presented after coitus. She had generalized urticaria, nasal congestion, secretions, conjunctivitis, and periorbital and labial oedema. No vaginal itching or burning was mentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total IgE was slightly elevated at 350 KIU/L. There's some indication that there are allergens present because the MAST CLA test was negative. So, no specific allergies detected yet? Or maybe it's just a general sign?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, there were historyamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva and sweat, and semen. All of those tests came out negative except for the partners' semen. The positive cell control (anti-IgE) test was also negative. So that means no IgE antibodies detected in the blood. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of sexual intercourse patterns after diagnosis:\n",
      "- First 6 months: condom wasn't used enough, close body contact caused urticaria, sneezing, conjunctivitis.\n",
      "- Then, she tried abstinence and slept apart for most of that period.\n",
      "- From 6 to 12 months: some body contact became possible (kissing/hugging), but still didn't cause severe symptoms. So maybe with the use of a condom and oral antihistamines, it could improve the situation?\n",
      "- In later years: Still used oral antihistamines before intercourse; but the condition was challenging on a regular basis by showing milder symptoms.\n",
      "- Skin prick test for the partners' semen found positive results at 10 mm diameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn't report any other sexual partners. So, this woman had her initial coitalization in a different setting where she wasn't using antihistamines, and it led to some issues after that, but without complications on her own. But with the same partners now, even when using antihistamines, she still faced challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to figure out how all these points fit into a medical report format. The user provided an example response with sections like Introduction, History of Condition, Prophylaxis and Response, Results from Allergen Tests, and Conclusion. That seems helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my task is to take this detailed information and structure it into the same sections. I need to make sure each section flows logically and covers all necessary points without being redundant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me go through each part:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Introduction**: This sets the stage with the patient's history of eczema and her symptoms post-coitus. That seems straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **History of Condition**: Here, we list the key facts about the patient, including the elevated IgE, negative MAST CLA, etc. I need to present these clearly, perhaps using bullet points or numbered lists as in the example.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prophylaxis and Response**: This section talks about her sexual history before diagnosis. She had poor contact, didn't use condoms much, used abstinence, but didn't show symptoms until later. The example includes points on early behavior, gradual improvement with condom use with antihistamines, challenges over time, and positive skin prick results.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Results from Allergen Tests**: This dives into the historyamine release tests for different substances. All were negative except for the partners' semen, which was also negative in a positive cell control test. The elevated IgE doesn't indicate specific allergens detected yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes her sexual health, noting her challenges despite using antihistamines and the positive skin prick result. It's important to stress that while she had anaphylaxis to human plasma before diagnosis, it was likely a more general issue with IgE.\n",
      "\n",

       "      <td>Okay, I need to convert all these notes into a medical report following the specified format. Let me start by reading through each part carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the patient's presentation: she was 17 years old, nonparous (non-pregnant), with a one-month history of a pelvic mass. That’s pretty significant because non-paranoids usually don’t have such a high risk of parity. They might have more concerning signs like nausea or vomiting.\\n\\nShe was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor in 2007. The CA-125 test showed a raised serum level, which is concerning. The patient wasn’t able to do the financial checkup, so she probably can't discuss other aspects of her medical history beyond what’s given here.\\n\\nAn intraoperative frozen section showed an immature teratoma, and she had fertility sparing surgery. I should include that. Fertility sparing is a standard surgical procedure for ovarian tumors in cases where there's some concern about whether the tumor might return or spread laterally.\\n\\nThe treatment involved several procedures: staging laparotomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy (which looks at the abdomen and pelvis), peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and an infracolic omentectomy. Each of these is a standard procedure for managing ovarian tumors, especially when they are localized.\\n\\nAfter the surgery, the postoperative histology report found a mature teratoma with focal areas of immature teratomas in the left ovary. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes, which is important for determining whether the tumor has spread beyond those areas.\\n\\nShe wasn’t supposed to be closely surveillance until six months after the first operation. She defaulted and went ahead, but her follow-up after that didn’t show any recurrence yet. The CT scan showed no residual disease, and the histology confirmed a mature teratoma with no immature cells.\\n\\nMoving on to the next year: she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and decided for medical advice again. She developed CA-125 raised levels post-chemotherapy, which was concerning because her tumor marker levels normalized. The pelvic masses showed some recurrence with larger size. CT scan revealed bilateral large adnexal masses involving the uterus and possibly the sigmoid colon.\\n\\nThere was suspicion of growing teratoma syndrome, which sounds like the tumors are interfering with each other, maybe causing a new growth. She had staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumor. Full pelvic lymphadenectomy was done as well.\\n\\nPostoperative CT scan showed no residual disease, histology confirmed a matureterima, but without any signs of further infiltration. So she was safe from recurrence at this time.\\n\\nI need to make sure each section follows the same structure: introduction with patient info and history, treatment plan, results and conclusions, follow-up, etc., all in a structured report format.</td>\n",

The abdominal pain was generalized, described as cramping, present throughout the day, had no association with meals, and was getting progressively worse. The patient also reported nausea and vomiting clear material. He denied any recent fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, change in bowel habits, sick contacts, and consumption of raw food. In addition, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash. After immigration from Vietnam 11 years ago, his only travel outside the USA was back to his homeland one year prior to this illness. The patient was not taking any prescribed or over the counter medications or herbal compounds and denied any allergies. His physical examination showed no skin rash or jaundice, cardiopulmonary examination showed no abnormality, and the abdomen was moderately distended, with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, and moderate ascites. There was no hepatomegaly or abdominal mass.\\nIn the emergency department, a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were significant for an elevated white blood count of 15.400 with 36% eosinophils. Abdominal and pelvis computer tomography (CT) showed moderate ascites with thickening of the gastric antrum and proximal small bowel (). The patient was admitted to the general medical service and placed on bowel rest and intravenous fluid hydration. Further he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which demonstrated mild duodenitis and biopsies demonstrated mild nonspecific acute inflammation predominantly lymphocytic. Stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. In addition, a screen for Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora, and Sarcocystis did not reveal evidence of recent infection. Over several days, the patient's abdominal pain improved, diet was advanced, and he was discharged home with an empiric trial of albendazole for a presumptive diagnosis of parasitic infection.\\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient was readmitted with worsening abdominal pain. Physical examination showed increased abdomen distention. Repeated blood counts and serum biochemical tests demonstrated an increase in white cell count of 17.100/mL with 71% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count of 12.141/弮l with normal upper limit &lt;450) (). Liver function tests continued to be within normal limits. Serum IgE level was elevated at 548 IU/mL (normal &lt; 180). Repeat stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. Furthermore, immunologic studies for Toxocara, Trichinella, Strongyloides, Filiaria, Schistosoma, Echinococcus, and Cysticerus were negative.\\nRepeated EGD was nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed no myelo- or lymphoproliferative findings. Serum 帣-2-microglobulin and LDH were 2.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.8??.0) and 170 U/L (normal: 80??00), respectively. Ultrasound guided abdominal paracentesis showed WBC count of 6600/mL, 95% of which were eosinophils (), LDH 284 mg/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL (simultaneous serum albumin 4.1 g/dL). In order to exclude small bowel lymphoma, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with full-thickness biopsy of an inflamed portion of the jejunum. This revealed skipped areas of hyperemia and discoloration involving the small intestine and to a lesser degree the colon in addition to yellow-green ascites (). Histopathological evaluation showed marked eosinophilic infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa with concomitant mild acute inflammatory reaction (). There was no evidence of malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasites.\\nThe constellation of clinical presentation and histopathological findings were suggestive of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Subsequently, the patient was started on oral prednisone (20 mg/day). Two weeks later and with noticeable symptomatic improvement, the prednisone was tapered over a two-week period. After completion of steroids, the patient's abdominal pain and physical finding of ascites completely resolved and a peripheral blood count revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 300/弮l (nL &lt; 450). Furthermore, IgE level dropped to 105 IU/mL and CT imaging of the abdominal and pelvis showed complete resolution of the ascites and small bowel thickening. Four months have elapsed since treatment and the patient remains asymptomatic on no medications.</td>\n",

History of Patient Presentations**\\nA 55-year-old Vietnamese male presents to a local emergency room after experiencing generalized abdominal pain for two weeks. The patient described cramping, generalized onset, and progressive worsening with no connection to meals. Pain persisted throughout the day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting ( Clear material). No significant recent symptoms or associations were noted, including fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bowel habits, sick contacts, raw food consumption, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash.\\n\\n### **2. Physical Examination**\\nThe patient had no significant skin rash, jaundice, or cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Abdominal distention was noted with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, mild ascites, and a normal liver function test (LFT).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Differential Diagnoses**\\n- **Eosinophilic gastroenteritis**: A likely cause given the generalized abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\\n- **Gastrointestinal dysfunction from other causes** (e.g., C. fumigansqueas, C. elegans).\\n- **Coch Rotavirus infection (Leptospirosis)**: Another possibility due to the patient's weight loss.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Treatment Plan**\\n#### **Initial Treatment**\\n- **Praziquantel (Albendazole)**: Given at 30 mg/day, with initial titration of prednisone.\\n- **Steroids**: Given for pain relief and inflammation reduction.\\n\\n#### **Progressive Management**\\n- **Praziquantel Extension**: tapered over a two-week period if symptoms improve and there is no evidence of severe gastrointestinal obstruction.\\n- **Bariatric Surgery (LBP)**: Considered for more significant issues, with full-thickness biopsy to exclude malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasitic tumors.\\n\\n#### **Follow-Up**\\n- Follow the treatment plan closely.

       "      <td>Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this task. The user provided a lot of medical information about a patient who went from presenting with abdominal pain for two weeks to being discharged with a diagnosis of parasitic infections like Cryptosporidium. Then it became worse again after two days, and they needed more treatment.\\n\\nI think the main steps here are to create a medical report based on this information. The user wants me to translate that into a proper medical format consistently. So I need to structure it with clear sections like history, physical exam, findings, differential diagnoses, treatment plan, and conclusion.\\n\\nFirst, I'll start by collecting all the patient's details—age, demographics, past history, presentation. Then move on to physical exam findings: abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss. Next, the differential diagnoses—I need to list possible causes like parasitic infections, gastrointestinal issues from other causes (like C. fumigansqueas), and things like C. elegans or Leptospirosis.\\n\\nAfter that, I'll outline the treatment plan based on each differential. The initial treatment is prednisone, which seems appropriate for pain management. Then steroids are given to reduce inflammation. Praziquantel (albendazole) should be used to treat parasitic infections if any are present. Lastly, they consider a bariatric surgery for more significant issues.\\n\\nIn the conclusion, I'll summarize how the treatment plan addressed the patient's condition effectively. Maybe include reassurance that the patient is doing well and offer further support options like follow-up or rehabilitation.\\n\\nI need to make sure each section flows into the next, using consistent terminology and structure. Also, I have to avoid any personal pronouns or names, just stick to the facts provided. The user also emphasized consistency in responses, so each part of the report should align without exception.\\n\\nI should watch out for specific terms like \"bowel sounds\" vs. \"bailey's test,\" but I can keep it simple as long as it's clear from context. Also, note that after discharge, there was a trial of albendazole, which is important to mention since they used that treatment.\\n\\nOverall, the goal is to present all this information in an organized, clear manner that other healthcare professionals could use directly. It's crucial to be precise with medical terminology and ensure each part builds upon the previous one logically.</td>\n",

The Phadia Immunocap and the Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test-chemiluminescent Assay (MAST CLA) test panels were negative []. Histamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva, sweat and semen were performed. The histamine release test procedure includes histamine release from peripheral whole-blood basophils, in a glass fiber prepared microtiter plate, by challenging 25 弮L heparinised whole blood with 25 弮L buffered allergen dilutions in various concentrations for 60 minutes at 37簞C. The assay is calibrated by a two-point standard curve and a positive cell control (anti-IgE) []. The test results are given as negative or positive. Histamine release tests for latex and for the partners saliva and sweat were negative, whereas the test was positive for the partners semen. The partners sweat, saliva, and semen were also tested in blood from a healthy control person, and these tests were all negative. Furthermore, a skin prick test was performed in the patient finding a positive reaction with a diameter of 12 (positive control 5) mm for the partners semen. Skin prick tests with the partners semen were also performed in two healthy women finding negative results.\\nDuring the first 6 months after a diagnosis of anaphylaxis to human seminal plasma was established, condom usage was not sufficient for prophylaxis. Even close body contact such as kissing and hugging would cause acute urticaria, sneezing, and conjunctivitis despite daily intake of oral antihistamines, however, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions did not occur. Sexual intercourse was only possible on prednisolone 25 mg/day; so, the couple opted for abstinence and slept in separate rooms during most of that period. Between 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis was established, gradually, body contact became possible, and some months later with the use of a condom and on premedication with oral antihistamines coitus was possible without associated symptoms. During the second and third years after diagnosis the patient would still use oral antihistamines prior to intercourse several times per week; however, the condition was challenged on a regular basis by the couple showing milder and milder symptoms. Five years after the diagnosis incidental episodes of provocation caused by condom defects and intended challenges without condom were not associated with significant symptoms. A skin prick test in the patient for the partners semen at that time found a positive reaction of a diameter of 10 (positive control 7) mm.

       "      <td>Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to format this information into a medical report. Let me read through it again and break down the key points.\\n\\nFirst, there's an 18-year-old woman with eczema history who presented after coitus. She had generalized urticaria, nasal congestion, secretions, conjunctivitis, and periorbital and labial oedema. No vaginal itching or burning was mentioned.\\n\\nTotal IgE was slightly elevated at 350 KIU/L. There's some indication that there are allergens present because the MAST CLA test was negative. So, no specific allergies detected yet? Or maybe it's just a general sign?\\n\\nThen, there were historyamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva and sweat, and semen. All of those tests came out negative except for the partners' semen. The positive cell control (anti-IgE) test was also negative. So that means no IgE antibodies detected in the blood. Hmm.\\n\\nIn terms of sexual intercourse patterns after diagnosis:\\n- First 6 months: condom wasn't used enough, close body contact caused urticaria, sneezing, conjunctivitis.\\n- Then, she tried abstinence and slept apart for most of that period.\\n- From 6 to 12 months: some body contact became possible (kissing/hugging), but still didn't cause severe symptoms. So maybe with the use of a condom and oral antihistamines, it could improve the situation?\\n- In later years: Still used oral antihistamines before intercourse; but the condition was challenging on a regular basis by showing milder symptoms.\\n- Skin prick test for the partners' semen found positive results at 10 mm diameter.\\n\\nShe didn't report any other sexual partners. So, this woman had her initial coitalization in a different setting where she wasn't using antihistamines, and it led to some issues after that, but without complications on her own. But with the same partners now, even when using antihistamines, she still faced challenges.\\n\\nI'm trying to figure out how all these points fit into a medical report format. The user provided an example response with sections like Introduction, History of Condition, Prophylaxis and Response, Results from Allergen Tests, and Conclusion. That seems helpful.\\n\\nSo, my task is to take this detailed information and structure it into the same sections. I need to make sure each section flows logically and covers all necessary points without being redundant.\\n\\nLet me go through each part:\\n\\n1. **Introduction**: This sets the stage with the patient's history of eczema and her symptoms post-coitus. That seems straightforward.\\n\\n2. **History of Condition**: Here, we list the key facts about the patient, including the elevated IgE, negative MAST CLA, etc. I need to present these clearly, perhaps using bullet points or numbered lists as in the example.\\n\\n3. **Prophylaxis and Response**: This section talks about her sexual history before diagnosis. She had poor contact, didn't use condoms much, used abstinence, but didn't show symptoms until later. The example includes points on early behavior, gradual improvement with condom use with antihistamines, challenges over time, and positive skin prick results.\\n\\n4. **Results from Allergen Tests**: This dives into the historyamine release tests for different substances. All were negative except for the partners' semen, which was also negative in a positive cell control test. The elevated IgE doesn't indicate specific allergens detected yet.\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes her sexual health, noting her challenges despite using antihistamines and the positive skin prick result. It's important to stress that while she had anaphylaxis to human plasma before diagnosis, it was likely a more general issue with IgE.\\n\\nI should make sure each section is concise, uses clear headings, and includes all relevant data without being too verbose. Also, I need to use consistent terminology and ensure that the flow from introduction to conclusion makes sense as one cohesive report.</td>\n",

Other tumour markers were not performed due to financial constraint. An intraoperative frozen section revealed immature teratoma and she underwent fertility sparing surgery. A staging laparotomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and infracolic omentectomy was performed. Postoperative histology report revealed mature teratoma with focal area of immature teratoma of the left ovary. There was no malignant cell infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. Histology revealed immature teratoma grade I, FIGO stage 1a. Despite being advised for close surveillance, she defaulted followup after 6 months postoperative.\\nOne year later, she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and resought medical advice. She developed radiological recurrence of pelvic mass with a raised serum CA-125 of 180 IU/L following which she completed 6 courses of systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel). After chemotherapy, the tumour marker normalised (<35 IU/L) but the pelvic mass progressively increased in size. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed presence of bilateral large adnexal masses with infiltration into uterus and also possibly to the sigmoid colon. Growing teratoma syndrome was suspected. She underwent staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumour. Full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was done. Postoperative CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no residual disease. Histology of excised mass revealed mature teratoma with no presence of immature cells. The patient remained with no recurrence at the time of this report, which is 8 months after the second operation for GTS.   \n",
       "1  A 55-year-old Vietnamese male with no significant past medical history presents to a local community hospital emergency department because of abdominal pain and distention of two-week duration. The abdominal pain was generalized, described as cramping, present throughout the day, had no association with meals, and was getting progressively worse. The patient also reported nausea and vomiting clear material. He denied any recent fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, change in bowel habits, sick contacts, and consumption of raw food. In addition, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash. After immigration from Vietnam 11 years ago, his only travel outside the USA was back to his homeland one year prior to this illness. The patient was not taking any prescribed or over the counter medications or herbal compounds and denied any allergies. His physical examination showed no skin rash or jaundice, cardiopulmonary examination showed no abnormality, and the abdomen was moderately distended, with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, and moderate ascites. There was no hepatomegaly or abdominal mass.\\nIn the emergency department, a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were significant for an elevated white blood count of 15.400 with 36% eosinophils. Abdominal and pelvis computer tomography (CT) showed moderate ascites with thickening of the gastric antrum and proximal small bowel (). The patient was admitted to the general medical service and placed on bowel rest and intravenous fluid hydration. Further he underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which demonstrated mild duodenitis and biopsies demonstrated mild nonspecific acute inflammation predominantly lymphocytic. Stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. In addition, a screen for Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Isospora, and Sarcocystis did not reveal evidence of recent infection. Over several days, the patient's abdominal pain improved, diet was advanced, and he was discharged home with an empiric trial of albendazole for a presumptive diagnosis of parasitic infection.\\nTwo weeks after discharge, the patient was readmitted with worsening abdominal pain. Physical examination showed increased abdomen distention. Repeated blood counts and serum biochemical tests demonstrated an increase in white cell count of 17.100/mL with 71% eosinophils (absolute eosinophil count of 12.141/弮l with normal upper limit <450) (). Liver function tests continued to be within normal limits. Serum IgE level was elevated at 548 IU/mL (normal < 180). Repeat stool tests were negative for ova and parasites. Furthermore, immunologic studies for Toxocara, Trichinella, Strongyloides, Filiaria, Schistosoma, Echinococcus, and Cysticerus were negative.\\nRepeated EGD was nondiagnostic. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood revealed no myelo- or lymphoproliferative findings. Serum 帣-2-microglobulin and LDH were 2.2 mg/dL (normal: 0.8??.0) and 170 U/L (normal: 80??00), respectively. Ultrasound guided abdominal paracentesis showed WBC count of 6600/mL, 95% of which were eosinophils (), LDH 284 mg/dL, albumin 3.2 g/dL (simultaneous serum albumin 4.1 g/dL). In order to exclude small bowel lymphoma, the patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with full-thickness biopsy of an inflamed portion of the jejunum. This revealed skipped areas of hyperemia and discoloration involving the small intestine and to a lesser degree the colon in addition to yellow-green ascites (). Histopathological evaluation showed marked eosinophilic infiltration of the muscularis propria and serosa with concomitant mild acute inflammatory reaction (). There was no evidence of malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasites.\\nThe constellation of clinical presentation and histopathological findings were suggestive of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Subsequently, the patient was started on oral prednisone (20 mg/day). Two weeks later and with noticeable symptomatic improvement, the prednisone was tapered over a two-week period. After completion of steroids, the patient's abdominal pain and physical finding of ascites completely resolved and a peripheral blood count revealed an absolute eosinophil count of 300/弮l (nL < 450). Furthermore, IgE level dropped to 105 IU/mL and CT imaging of the abdominal and pelvis showed complete resolution of the ascites and small bowel thickening. Four months have elapsed since treatment and the patient remains asymptomatic on no medications.   \n",

The chest pain was described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, 8/10 in severity, and radiated down his left arm. Upon presentation, vital signs were stable, cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits, and the electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no ST/T-waves changes. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricle function and no wall motion abnormalities. Of note, the patient had a similar presentation and ER course two weeks prior.\\nDue to the fact that the patient continued to have 8/10 chest pain during his hospital stay, coronary angiogram was ultimately done. The angiogram showed normal coronary arteries without evidence of coronary vasospasm or an existing myocardial bridge. Slow flow, however, was noted in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). An intracoronary adenosine challenge was done and showed normalization of the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) frame count (). The patient was given the diagnosis of coronary slow flow phenomenon and started on dipyridamole 50 mg three times a day and discharged home.\\nOn six-month followup, the patient reported that he had been chest-pain-free. Shortly after his six-month followup, the patient ran out of his medicine and again began to experience chest pain. Once the patient was placed back on his dipyridamole, he became chest-pain-free.   \n",

The patient presented with a single episode of chest pain at rest described as pressure-like and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Admission EKG revealed T-wave inversion in the anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval (). Cardiac enzymes were also noted to be elevated (CKMB 8.3 IU/l and troponin I 1.14 ng/mL). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with no wall motion abnormalities or left ventricular hypertrophy. A diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was made, and the patient was started on the appropriate acute coronary syndrome medications. Left heart catheterization was done the following day and revealed normal coronary arteries with slow flow noted in LAD. An intracoronary adenosine challenge was done that showed normalization of the TIMI frame count (). The patient was given the diagnosis of coronary slow flow and started on amlodipine 2.5 mg daily. On 6-month followup, the patient reports that he has been chest-pain-free.   \n",

There was no vaginal itching or burning.\\nTotal IgE was slightly elevated, 350 (0??50) KIU/L. The Phadia Immunocap and the Multiple Allergen Simultaneous Test-chemiluminescent Assay (MAST CLA) test panels were negative []. Histamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva, sweat and semen were performed. The histamine release test procedure includes histamine release from peripheral whole-blood basophils, in a glass fiber prepared microtiter plate, by challenging 25 弮L heparinised whole blood with 25 弮L buffered allergen dilutions in various concentrations for 60 minutes at 37簞C. The assay is calibrated by a two-point standard curve and a positive cell control (anti-IgE) []. The test results are given as negative or positive. Histamine release tests for latex and for the partners saliva and sweat were negative, whereas the test was positive for the partners semen. The partners sweat, saliva, and semen were also tested in blood from a healthy control person, and these tests were all negative. Furthermore, a skin prick test was performed in the patient finding a positive reaction with a diameter of 12 (positive control 5) mm for the partners semen. Skin prick tests with the partners semen were also performed in two healthy women finding negative results.\\nDuring the first 6 months after a diagnosis of anaphylaxis to human seminal plasma was established, condom usage was not sufficient for prophylaxis. Even close body contact such as kissing and hugging would cause acute urticaria, sneezing, and conjunctivitis despite daily intake of oral antihistamines, however, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions did not occur. Sexual intercourse was only possible on prednisolone 25 mg/day; so, the couple opted for abstinence and slept in separate rooms during most of that period. Between 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis was established, gradually, body contact became possible, and some months later with the use of a condom and on premedication with oral antihistamines coitus was possible without associated symptoms. During the second and third years after diagnosis the patient would still use oral antihistamines prior to intercourse several times per week; however, the condition was challenged on a regular basis by the couple showing milder and milder symptoms. Five years after the diagnosis incidental episodes of provocation caused by condom defects and intended challenges without condom were not associated with significant symptoms. A skin prick test in the patient for the partners semen at that time found a positive reaction of a diameter of 10 (positive control 7) mm. The patient did not report any other sexual partners.   \n",

She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor on January 15, 2007. Despite having the ability to discuss her medical history due to the lack of other concerns, she chose to proceed unopposed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Treatment Plan**\\nThe patient underwent several surgical procedures:\\n- **Staging Laparotomy**: To localize the tumor and remove it.\\n- **Left Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: To visualize the abdomen and pelvis.\\n- **Peritoneal Cytology**: To examine the peritoneal cavity.\\n- **Pelvic Lymph Node Sampling**: To assess the extent of lymphoid involvement.\\n- **Infracolic Omentectomy**: To remove any small masses present in the pelvic bones.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Treatment Outcome**\\nAfter the surgery, the postoperative histology report revealed a mature left ovary tumor with focal areas of immature teratomas. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. The tumor cells were FIGO stage 1a and grade I according to FIGO staging.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Follow-Up**\\nOne year later, she presented again following radiological recurrence in pelvic mass and her CA-125 levels increased to 180 IU/L due to chemotherapy. She underwent complete excision of the tumor and full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The postoperative CT scan revealed no residual disease.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\nAt this time, there was no recurrence at the report date, which is eight months after the second surgery for GTS (Growing Teratomics and Solid tumors). All findings were consistent with a localized, FIGO stage 1a, grade I tumor.   \n",
       "1  **Medical Report**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. History of Patient Presentations**\\nA 55-year-old Vietnamese male presents to a local emergency room after experiencing generalized abdominal pain for two weeks. The patient described cramping, generalized onset, and progressive worsening with no connection to meals. Pain persisted throughout the day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting ( Clear material). No significant recent symptoms or associations were noted, including fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bowel habits, sick contacts, raw food consumption, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash.\\n\\n### **2. Physical Examination**\\nThe patient had no significant skin rash, jaundice, or cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Abdominal distention was noted with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, mild ascites, and a normal liver function test (LFT).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Differential Diagnoses**\\n- **Eosinophilic gastroenteritis**: A likely cause given the generalized abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\\n- **Gastrointestinal dysfunction from other causes** (e.g., C. fumigansqueas, C. elegans).\\n- **Coch Rotavirus infection (Leptospirosis)**: Another possibility due to the patient's weight loss.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **4. Treatment Plan**\\n#### **Initial Treatment**\\n- **Praziquantel (Albendazole)**: Given at 30 mg/day, with initial titration of prednisone.\\n- **Steroids**: Given for pain relief and inflammation reduction.\\n\\n#### **Progressive Management**\\n- **Praziquantel Extension**: tapered over a two-week period if symptoms improve and there is no evidence of severe gastrointestinal obstruction.\\n- **Bariatric Surgery (LBP)**: Considered for more significant issues, with full-thickness biopsy to exclude malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasitic tumors.\\n\\n#### **Follow-Up**\\n- Follow the treatment plan closely. Reassure the patient that they are doing well and offer further support options as needed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **5. Conclusion**\\nThe treatment plan addresses the patient's condition effectively, with prednisone for pain management, steroids to reduce inflammation, and Praziquantel for parasitic infections. The full-thickness biopsy indicated no malignancy or tumors, and there is no evidence of severe gastrointestinal obstruction. Follow-up will be scheduled once the treatment has been appropriately managed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Reassurance:** The patient is doing well, and further support options are available as needed.   \n",

Vital signs were stable, cardiac biomarkers within normal limits, and the EKG showed no ST/T-waves changes. The echocardiogram revealed normal ventricular function and no wall motion abnormalities.\\n\\n**Present Examination Findings**\\nUpon presentation, chest pain was characterized as moderate in severity (8/10). Detailed examination revealed normal vital signs. The transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed normal left ventricle function and no evidence of wall motion abnormalities or coronary vasospasm. Two weeks prior, similar chest pain and ER course were reported.\\n\\n**Detailed Findings from Tests**\\nChronic cardiokymography further identified normal coronary arteries without evidence of coronary vasospasm or myocardial bridge. Slow flow was noted in the LAD, and an intracoronary adenosine challenge revealed normalization of TIMI frame counts.\\n\\n**Diagnosis**\\nThe patient's presentation led to a diagnosis of coronary slow flow phenomenon. Treatment included dipyridamole 50 mg three times daily, with discharge home.\\n\\n**Followup Results**\\nSix months later, the patient reported chest-pain-free following treatment. Subsequently, the patient experienced chest pain, which was resolved after placement of dipyridamole.

The patient presented as \"pressure-like\" and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis, which may be related to underlying conditions or stressors.  \\n\\n** presentation:**  \\nThe admission was confirmed by an EKG, which revealed a T-wave inversion in the anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval (0.72 s, 599 ms). Cardiac enzymes were elevated, with CKMB (8.3 IU/l) and troponin I (1.14 ng/mL), both of which are indicative of ST-seegulation. However, there was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or wall motion abnormalities in the echocardiogram.  \\n\\n**History & Diagnosis:**  \\nThe patient was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to the elevated CKMB and troponin I levels. The appropriate acute coronary syndrome medications were prescribed, including amloidine 250 mg daily, which was effective in reducing chest pain on follow-up evaluation.  \\n\\n**Left Heart Catheterization:**  \\nThe following day, a left heart catheterization revealed normal coronary artery function with no significant wall motion abnormalities or left ventricular hypertrophy. The LAD (left atrial distal) flow was slow, as observed in the intracoronary adenosine challenge test, which normalized the TIMI frame count.  \\n\\n**Followup:**  \\nOne month post-discharge, the patient reported that chest pain had been effectively eliminated, with no recurrent episodes of pressure-like chest pain or diaphoresis.  \\n\\n**Conclusion:**  \\nThe patient was successfully diagnosed with NSTEMI and adequately treated with acute coronary syndrome medications to alleviate his symptoms.   \n",

Despite no vaginal itching or burning, the patient's history was documented.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **History of Condition**\\n\\n- Total IgE: Slightly elevated (350 KIU/L), likely a general sign due to the presence of IgE.\\n- MAST CLA Test: Negative for both human seminal plasma and coital fluid.\\n- Historyamine Release Tests: All negative except for partners' semen, which was also negative in a positive cell control test.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Prophylaxis and Response**\\n\\n**1. Early Behavior**\\n- First 6 months: Poor condom usage, close body contact without severe symptoms.\\n- 6-12 months: Gradual improvement with condom use in coital fluid (no current symptoms).\\n- Later years: Continue oral antihistamines before intercourse; condition challenging on regular intervals.\\n\\n**2. Challenges Over Time**\\n- Early diagnosis: Condition was challenging after initial contact.\\n- Recent: Severe challenges despite using antihistamines regularly; some mild reductions observed.\\n\\n**3. Positive Skin prick Test**\\n- Partner's semen test found a positive result (10 mm diameter) in the patient, indicating potential for anaphylactic response.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Results from Allergen Tests**\\n\\n- Historyamine Release Tests confirmed no specific allergens detected (negative results).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Conclusion**\\n\\nThe patient had a history of eczema leading to anaphylaxis post-coitus. Her sexual history revealed challenges without condom use and difficulties with early contact, though significant improvement occurred over time with condom use in coital fluid. Despite earlier reliance on human seminal plasma for antihistamines, the presence of IgE suggests potential for anaphylactic response. The positive skin prick result (10 mm diameter) indicates a possible onset of the condition when using condoms and antihistamines together.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis report highlights her sexual health challenges and the role of antihistamines in mitigating symptoms, emphasizing the need for ongoing support to prevent future complications.   \n",

Let me start by reading through each part carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the patient's presentation: she was 17 years old, nonparous (non-pregnant), with a one-month history of a pelvic mass. That’s pretty significant because non-paranoids usually don’t have such a high risk of parity. They might have more concerning signs like nausea or vomiting.\\n\\nShe was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor in 2007. The CA-125 test showed a raised serum level, which is concerning. The patient wasn’t able to do the financial checkup, so she probably can't discuss other aspects of her medical history beyond what’s given here.\\n\\nAn intraoperative frozen section showed an immature teratoma, and she had fertility sparing surgery. I should include that. Fertility sparing is a standard surgical procedure for ovarian tumors in cases where there's some concern about whether the tumor might return or spread laterally.\\n\\nThe treatment involved several procedures: staging laparotomy, left salpingo-oophorectomy (which looks at the abdomen and pelvis), peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and an infracolic omentectomy. Each of these is a standard procedure for managing ovarian tumors, especially when they are localized.\\n\\nAfter the surgery, the postoperative histology report found a mature teratoma with focal areas of immature teratomas in the left ovary. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes, which is important for determining whether the tumor has spread beyond those areas.\\n\\nShe wasn’t supposed to be closely surveillance until six months after the first operation. She defaulted and went ahead, but her follow-up after that didn’t show any recurrence yet. The CT scan showed no residual disease, and the histology confirmed a mature teratoma with no immature cells.\\n\\nMoving on to the next year: she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and decided for medical advice again. She developed CA-125 raised levels post-chemotherapy, which was concerning because her tumor marker levels normalized. The pelvic masses showed some recurrence with larger size. CT scan revealed bilateral large adnexal masses involving the uterus and possibly the sigmoid colon.\\n\\nThere was suspicion of growing teratoma syndrome, which sounds like the tumors are interfering with each other, maybe causing a new growth. She had staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumor.

The user provided a lot of medical information about a patient who went from presenting with abdominal pain for two weeks to being discharged with a diagnosis of parasitic infections like Cryptosporidium. Then it became worse again after two days, and they needed more treatment.\\n\\nI think the main steps here are to create a medical report based on this information. The user wants me to translate that into a proper medical format consistently. So I need to structure it with clear sections like history, physical exam, findings, differential diagnoses, treatment plan, and conclusion.\\n\\nFirst, I'll start by collecting all the patient's details—age, demographics, past history, presentation. Then move on to physical exam findings: abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss. Next, the differential diagnoses—I need to list possible causes like parasitic infections, gastrointestinal issues from other causes (like C. fumigansqueas), and things like C. elegans or Leptospirosis.\\n\\nAfter that, I'll outline the treatment plan based on each differential. The initial treatment is prednisone, which seems appropriate for pain management. Then steroids are given to reduce inflammation. Praziquantel (albendazole) should be used to treat parasitic infections if any are present. Lastly, they consider a bariatric surgery for more significant issues.\\n\\nIn the conclusion, I'll summarize how the treatment plan addressed the patient's condition effectively. Maybe include reassurance that the patient is doing well and offer further support options like follow-up or rehabilitation.\\n\\nI need to make sure each section flows into the next, using consistent terminology and structure. Also, I have to avoid any personal pronouns or names, just stick to the facts provided. The user also emphasized consistency in responses, so each part of the report should align without exception.\\n\\nI should watch out for specific terms like \"bowel sounds\" vs. \"bailey's test,\" but I can keep it simple as long as it's clear from context. Also, note that after discharge, there was a trial of albendazole, which is important to mention since they used that treatment.\\n\\nOverall, the goal is to present all this information in an organized, clear manner that other healthcare professionals could use directly. It's crucial to be precise with medical terminology and ensure each part builds upon the previous one logically.  \n",

For example, \"43-year-old man\" instead of just 'man', and specify the exact symptoms like 'chest pain described as a pressure-like sensation in the center of his chest, 8/10 in severity' if needed.\\n\\nI should make sure each section flows logically, starting from the case details up to the followup results. It's important to use consistent medical terminology without adding my own information unless it's required by the guidelines.\\n\\nLet me go through each part step by step:\\n1. Introduction: Include age, past history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension.\\n2. Present examination findings: Details about chest pain symptoms, vital signs, EKG results, echocardiogram, etc.\\n3. Detailed findings from tests: Expand on each test's outcome (e.g., no ST/T-waves changes).\\n4. Followup results: Include the six-month followup report, details of chest-pain-free status after treatment and any subsequent episodes.\\n\\nI should ensure that all data points are included without repetition and that the language is clear and professional. Also, I need to maintain consistency in formatting so each section aligns with the previous one.  \n",

The user provided some medical notes from a second case involving a 70-year-old gentleman with history of squamous cell carcinoma on the tongue base six years prior. He had chest pain at rest, which was described as pressure-like, associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Admission EKG showed T-wave inversion in anterior leads and a prolonged QT interval. Cardiac enzymes were elevated with CKMB 8.3 IU/l and troponin I 1.14 ng/mL.\\n\\nAdmission echocardiogram was normal, no wall motion issues or left ventricular hypertrophy. Diagnosis of NSTEMI made, medications taken as acute coronary syndrome. Left heart catheterization showed normal coronary arteries with slow flow noted in LAD. Intracoronary adenosine challenge normalized TIMI frame count.\\n\\nFollowup: chest pain free. I need to present this into a medical report following the format provided earlier, which uses only the information from the notes and consistently formats each section with subheadings like Introduction, Presentation, History &diagnosis, etc.\\n\\nFirst, I should introduce the case, mention the presentation with chest pain, history of squamous cell carcinoma. Then go into the ECG findings showing T wave inversion and prolonged QT. Cardiac enzymes elevated. Ad Mitrochorecographic normal findings. Diagnosis NSTEMI. Medications taken as acute. Left heart catheterization shows normal coronary artery function but slow flow in LAD. Intracoronary adenosine challenge normalized TIMI. Followup showing chest pain free.\\n\\nI need to ensure each section is clear, uses the provided information without any extra content. Make sure subheadings are used consistently throughout. No markdown, just plain text with clear headers.\\n\\nI should double-check all findings: T wave inversion, prolonged QT, elevated CKMB and troponin I, normal ECG, NSTEMI, medications, LAD flow in left heart catheterization, adenosine challenge normalization, chest pain free at followup. No other details from the notes were not included.\\n\\nPutting it all together, making sure each section flows logically into the next.  \n",
       "4  Okay, so I'm trying to understand how to format this information into a medical report. Let me read through it again and break down the key points.\\n\\nFirst, there's an 18-year-old woman with eczema history who presented after coitus. She had generalized urticaria, nasal congestion, secretions, conjunctivitis, and periorbital and labial oedema. No vaginal itching or burning was mentioned.\\n\\nTotal IgE was slightly elevated at 350 KIU/L. There's some indication that there are allergens present because the MAST CLA test was negative. So, no specific allergies detected yet? Or maybe it's just a general sign?\\n\\nThen, there were historyamine release tests for latex, the partners saliva and sweat, and semen. All of those tests came out negative except for the partners' semen. The positive cell control (anti-IgE) test was also negative. So that means no IgE antibodies detected in the blood. Hmm.\\n\\nIn terms of sexual intercourse patterns after diagnosis:\\n- First 6 months: condom wasn't used enough, close body contact caused urticaria, sneezing, conjunctivitis.\\n- Then, she tried abstinence and slept apart for most of that period.\\n- From 6 to 12 months: some body contact became possible (kissing/hugging), but still didn't cause severe symptoms. So maybe with the use of a condom and oral antihistamines, it could improve the situation?\\n- In later years: Still used oral antihistamines before intercourse; but the condition was challenging on a regular basis by showing milder symptoms.\\n- Skin prick test for the partners' semen found positive results at 10 mm diameter.\\n\\nShe didn't report any other sexual partners. So, this woman had her initial coitalization in a different setting where she wasn't using antihistamines, and it led to some issues after that, but without complications on her own. But with the same partners now, even when using antihistamines, she still faced challenges.\\n\\nI'm trying to figure out how all these points fit into a medical report format. The user provided an example response with sections like Introduction, History of Condition, Prophylaxis and Response, Results from Allergen Tests, and Conclusion. That seems helpful.\\n\\nSo, my task is to take this detailed information and structure it into the same sections. I need to make sure each section flows logically and covers all necessary points without being redundant.\\n\\nLet me go through each part:\\n\\n1. **Introduction**: This sets the stage with the patient's history of eczema and her symptoms post-coitus. That seems straightforward.\\n\\n2. **History of Condition**: Here, we list the key facts about the patient, including the elevated IgE, negative MAST CLA, etc. I need to present these clearly, perhaps using bullet points or numbered lists as in the example.\\n\\n3. **Prophylaxis and Response**: This section talks about her sexual history before diagnosis. She had poor contact, didn't use condoms much, used abstinence, but didn't show symptoms until later. The example includes points on early behavior, gradual improvement with condom use with antihistamines, challenges over time, and positive skin prick results.\\n\\n4. **Results from Allergen Tests**: This dives into the historyamine release tests for different substances. All were negative except for the partners' semen, which was also negative in a positive cell control test. The elevated IgE doesn't indicate specific allergens detected yet.\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**: Summarizes her sexual health, noting her challenges despite using antihistamines and the positive skin prick result. It's important to stress that while she had anaphylaxis to human plasma before diagnosis, it was likely a more general issue with IgE.\\n\\nI should make sure each section is concise, uses clear headings, and includes all relevant data without being too verbose. Also, I need to use consistent terminology and ensure that the flow from introduction to conclusion makes sense as one cohesive report.  "

      "### **Introduction**\n",
      "The patient is a 17-year-old nonparous girl who presented with a one-month history of a noticeable pelvic mass. She was diagnosed with a left ovarian tumor on January 15, 2007. Despite having the ability to discuss her medical history due to the lack of other concerns, she chose to proceed unopposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Plan**\n",
      "The patient underwent several surgical procedures:\n",
      "- **Staging Laparotomy**: To localize the tumor and remove it.\n",
      "- **Left Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: To visualize the abdomen and pelvis.\n",
      "- **Peritoneal Cytology**: To examine the peritoneal cavity.\n",
      "- **Pelvic Lymph Node Sampling**: To assess the extent of lymphoid involvement.\n",
      "- **Infracolic Omentectomy**: To remove any small masses present in the pelvic bones.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Treatment Outcome**\n",
      "After the surgery, the postoperative histology report revealed a mature left ovary tumor with focal areas of immature teratomas. There was no tumor infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. The tumor cells were FIGO stage 1a and grade I according to FIGO staging.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Follow-Up**\n",
      "One year later, she presented again following radiological recurrence in pelvic mass and her CA-125 levels increased to 180 IU/L due to chemotherapy. She underwent complete excision of the tumor and full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The postoperative CT scan revealed no residual disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Conclusion**\n",
      "At this time, there was no recurrence at the report date, which is eight months after the second surgery for GTS (Growing Teratomics and Solid tumors). All findings were consistent with a localized, FIGO stage 1a, grade I tumor.\n"

      "### **1. History of Patient Presentations**\n",
      "A 55-year-old Vietnamese male presents to a local emergency room after experiencing generalized abdominal pain for two weeks. The patient described cramping, generalized onset, and progressive worsening with no connection to meals. Pain persisted throughout the day, accompanied by nausea and vomiting ( Clear material). No significant recent symptoms or associations were noted, including fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, bowel habits, sick contacts, raw food consumption, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint swelling, and skin rash.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **2. Physical Examination**\n",
      "The patient had no significant skin rash, jaundice, or cardiopulmonary abnormalities. Abdominal distention was noted with active bowel sounds, diffuse tenderness without rebound, mild ascites, and a normal liver function test (LFT).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **3. Differential Diagnoses**\n",
      "- **Eosinophilic gastroenteritis**: A likely cause given the generalized abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n",
      "- **Gastrointestinal dysfunction from other causes** (e.g., C. fumigansqueas, C. elegans).\n",
      "- **Coch Rotavirus infection (Leptospirosis)**: Another possibility due to the patient's weight loss.\n",

      "- **Praziquantel (Albendazole)**: Given at 30 mg/day, with initial titration of prednisone.\n",
      "- **Steroids**: Given for pain relief and inflammation reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Progressive Management**\n",
      "- **Praziquantel Extension**: tapered over a two-week period if symptoms improve and there is no evidence of severe gastrointestinal obstruction.\n",
      "- **Bariatric Surgery (LBP)**: Considered for more significant issues, with full-thickness biopsy to exclude malignancy, granuloma, TB, or parasitic tumors.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Follow-Up**\n",
      "- Follow the treatment plan closely. Reassure the patient that they are doing well and offer further support options as needed.\n",

      "### **5. Conclusion**\n",
      "The treatment plan addresses the patient's condition effectively, with prednisone for pain management, steroids to reduce inflammation, and Praziquantel for parasitic infections. The full-thickness biopsy indicated no malignancy or tumors, and there is no evidence of severe gastrointestinal obstruction. Follow-up will be scheduled once the treatment has been appropriately managed.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reassurance:** The patient is doing well, and further support options are available as needed.\n"
