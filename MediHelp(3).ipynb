They include patient history, physical exam findings, imaging, treatment, complications, etc. So yes, they're medical notes.\\n\\nNow, I need to format them into the SOAP structure. The user mentioned that each section should have specific headings: subjective, objective, assessment, and plan.\\n\\nStarting with Subjective:\\n- Check if there's a subjective report, which is when the patient describes their symptoms. In this case, the girl had a pelvic mass and default follow-up after 6 months post-op. I don't see any symptoms mentioned, so Subjective will have no information here.\\n- History of present illness: They presented with the lump and default follow-up. So that's included in objective.\\n\\nMoving to Objective:\\n- Vital signs: She didn’t report any, so nothing.\\n- Physical exam findings: She had pelvic mass, etc., but it's considered a differential because they’re not palpable yet. So include that as an objective finding.\\n- Imaging results: No images mentioned except CT of abdomen and pelvis, which was done to find masses. Include this.\\n- Treatment history: They took chemotherapy after default follow-up. I'll note that as the objective treatment.\\n- Complications: She developed recurrence with CA-125 down from 350 to 180, and had cystic fibrosis. These are complications in a differential since they could be unrelated. Include them.\\n\\nNext is Assessment:\\n- Problem: The patient has an ovarian lump that's not palpable yet.\\n- Differential: The tumor can be benign or malignant; financial constraint prevented further testing.\\n- Diagnosis: Mature left ovary (FOD4, stage 2a).\\n- Differentiation: She’s likely benign. Possible differential diagnosis includes other ovarian lesions from chemotherapy or radiation, and possibly metastatic cancer due to recurrence.\\n\\nFinally, Plan:\\n- Future action: She needs another imaging (done at 8 months post-op) to evaluate for malignancy. Follow-up with the oncologist after that.\\n- Other actions: Continue with chemotherapy course and monitor for any complications.\\n\\nI think I covered all parts of the SOAP format. Let me make sure each section aligns correctly under the respective headers as per the user's example. Yeah, looks good!\")"

Other tumour markers were not performed due to financial constraint. An intraoperative frozen section revealed immature teratoma and she underwent fertility sparing surgery. A staging laparotomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal cytology, pelvic lymph nodes sampling, and infracolic omentectomy was performed. Postoperative histology report revealed mature teratoma with focal area of immature teratoma of the left ovary. There was no malignant cell infiltration to the omentum or lymph nodes. Histology revealed immature teratoma grade I, FIGO stage 1a. Despite being advised for close surveillance, she defaulted followup after 6 months postoperative. One year later, she presented with lower abdominal discomfort and resought medical advice. She developed radiological recurrence of pelvic mass with a raised serum CA-125 of 180 IU/L following which she completed 6 courses of systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin-paclitaxel). After chemotherapy, the tumour marker normalised (<35 IU/L) but the pelvic mass progressively increased in size. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed presence of bilateral large adnexal masses with infiltration into uterus and also possibly to the sigmoid colon. Growing teratoma syndrome was suspected. She underwent staging laparotomy and complete excision of the tumour. Full bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was done. Postoperative CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no residual disease. Histology of excised mass revealed mature teratoma with no presence of immature cells.
